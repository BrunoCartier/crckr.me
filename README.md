## Dead simple website explaining what Crocker's Rules are

### Why?
Websites talking about these rules are kind of ugly, or don't add
any information, or both.
I wanted to make an easy-to-share easy-to-read website, that anyone
can give to the people they wish to use Crocker's Rules with.

### Contribute
Pull requests are welcome.
Don't forget you have to make your style changes in the LESS file.
Pages translations (Spanish & German for example) would be awesome :)
