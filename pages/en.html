        Declaring yourself to be operating by "Crocker's Rules" means that other people are allowed to optimize their
        messages for information, not for being nice to you. Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted full
        responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended, it's your fault. Anyone is allowed to
        call you a moron and claim to be doing you a favor. (Which, in point of fact, they would be. One of the big
        problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance
        around it.) Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant information in the
        minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social formatting. Obviously, don't declare yourself to be
        operating by Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Note that Crocker's Rules does <em>not</em> mean you can insult people; it means that <em>other</em>
        people don't have to worry about whether <em>they</em> are insulting <em>you</em>.</strong> Crocker's Rules
        are a discipline, not a privilege. Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does not imply reciprocity.
        How could it? Crocker's Rules are something you do for yourself, to maximize information received - not
        something you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Crocker's Rules" are named after Lee Daniel Crocker.
